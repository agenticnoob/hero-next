# Hero Next

`@viselora/hero-next` is a standalone private Next.js App Router personal site.
It consumes published Viselora packages through their public entrypoints.
Both `@viselora/dom-webgl` and `@viselora/scroll-adapters` are pinned to
`0.1.0-alpha.2` from npm; see [current verification](./docs/STATUS.md).

The current experience is a four-chapter personal narrative. The opening Hub
first presents site-level context beside the breathing tetrahedron, then hands
those two side columns to chapter one before spatial flight begins. Each chapter
owns one tetrahedron face, unique transition-side information, a progressively
screen-locked triangular reveal whose rotation and centering finish at the DOM
handoff, one continuous semantic body, signal-only entry/exit runways, and a
reversible exit that preselects the following portal content under full cover.
The chapters cover self, AI/philosophy axioms, public builds, and
public channels. Chapter two is a scroll-driven circular title index
and a stack of differently sized, postage-edged article sheets, rendered through
one managed surface in the existing scene. Scroll continuously drives their
right-side arc arrivals; only overflowing text adds a reading segment before
the next sheet. Article data, sizing and motion configuration stay in `src/axioms/`;
see [the reader design and extension guide](./docs/visual-design.md#第二章扇面目录与文章纸卡).
Chapter three places the four projects on the walls of a mouse-driven room on
wide screens with a fine pointer. Edge gestures turn to adjacent walls; project
buttons and a stable source link preserve keyboard access. Mobile and touch
layouts retain the normal project list. See [project room behavior](./docs/visual-design.md#第三章四面项目空间).
Chapter four uses centered, enlarged desktop rows with platform names and account
information. Fine-pointer desktop previews follow the whole row; clicking opens
the profile. Narrow and touch screens show all account details, QR images and
text directly in a scrollable list. Atlas endpoints follow each layout.
See [public channel behavior](./docs/visual-design.md#第四章公共入口与跟随预览).
The fourth exit leads into a continuous daily Timeline. Date and compact tool
names on the left always pair with that same day's event on the right. Multiple
days emerge as small text at the upper sides, grow and descend together, then
leave through the bottom, with the tetrahedron held in the center. In this final
Hub, scrolling adds damped spacecraft-like thrust, a small scale reduction, subtle
vibration and banking, slow self rotation and a stronger Fresnel edge. Native
Viselora DOM-text targets and managed subtree transforms own the rendering.
Each date stays intact; reduced motion selects one stationary date at a time.
The previous final copy and bottom links are removed. The desktop project room
retains its selected wall and pointer interaction independently of scroll; both
transition endpoints settle on the first wall.

Each tetrahedron face keeps paired atlas tiles derived from that chapter body's
real content. Ordinary DOM chapters use their opening copy and final content;
chapter two uses the first and last reader frames. The desktop project room
uses the same first-wall composition at both endpoints, while its mobile
layout uses the ordinary DOM opening and final project card. Chapter four uses
the same unselected five-entry directory at both endpoints. Atlas drawing
and the semantic body share the same responsive geometry, including the profile columns,
balanced heading, model exclusion, and profile speech bubble. Both tiles are
packed up front, so exit switches to the prepared endpoint without rebuilding or
uploading a texture on scroll, while face-space UV lock advances continuously
with the approach. The opening and intermediate Hubs keep their no-spin breathing and floating motion with
stronger damped pointer parallax. Its single managed
material combines existing directional lighting with an app-owned Fresnel edge
light and reduced flat/emissive fill for clearer depth; the edge light fades as
the target face reaches full screen lock. No ground plane, shadow map, outline
mesh, duplicate tetrahedron, or additional render pass is used.

Chinese and English copy share one typed content model and one persisted locale
store. Chapter one adds a scene-native personal GLB to the established scene
without creating another renderer, canvas, scene, or render pass. The same
model starts as a shallow relief attached to the first tetrahedron face,
expands out of that face into the fixed body position, and returns to the face
during exit. While attached, it consumes the tetrahedron effect's final transform,
including Timeline rotation, thrust and scale. Its semantic profile copy remains split into explicit left and
right columns gathered around the center. A rounded-rectangle manga speech
bubble with a background-color fill and foreground-color text stays above the
model's head without changing size or shape. Its front, side, and back messages
type in one character at a time, hold briefly at the matching model angle, and
delete one character at a time before the next stage, using the same reversible
one-turn body progress. Reduced motion retains the complete front message. Each
rendered line resolves its own displacement against the combined responsive
GLB and speech-bubble exclusions, leaving the outer gutters available for the
wrap instead of moving a whole section at once. All four chapter DOM cycles
render body content only; empty entry/exit runways remain solely as 3D
transition signals. The exit starts when the body bottom reaches the viewport
bottom. That same body progress maps the centered model deterministically to
one clockwise turn. The tetrahedron approach and retreat keep the model's
face-local pose still. The checked-in model is a Draco/WebP derivative under
5 MB, while the original source asset remains outside the repository. Its
native GLB material uses geometry normals and a restrained texture-matched emissive fill, with one
stable light-neutral base tint across both themes so a theme commit cannot
multiply the texture by the darker page background. Pointer lighting eases down
while a chapter is active so it remains a restrained spatial cue rather than a
dominant highlight.

A real mesh hold remains the site-wide two-tone theme switch. It is enabled
only at a complete Hub, commits once after the radial transition covers the
viewport, and persists the committed scheme locally across refreshes.

## Run

Use Node.js 22 or newer and npm 10. From this directory:

```bash
npm ci
npm run sync:journal -- --source /Users/ai/projects/vibe-journal-pipeline/data
npm run dev
```

This project includes its own dependency lockfile, TypeScript configuration,
and test setup. It does not require a checkout of the Viselora repository.
The sync command reads Timeline events and daily tool lists and must run before the first dev
session or build. Run it again and rebuild to publish updated data. Generated
snapshots are gitignored. See [journal publishing](./docs/journal-publishing.md)
for the cross-repository setup. GitHub Actions validates and builds the website,
deploys the prebuilt output to Vercel, then checks the public snapshot against its
source commit. Direct Vercel Git deployments are disabled. Cloud activation and
verified production runs are recorded in [current status](./docs/STATUS.md).

Use the Network URL printed by Next.js to open the app from another device. The
development allowlist intentionally accepts any dotted hostname or IPv4 origin,
so DHCP address changes do not require a configuration edit and the HMR
WebSocket remains available. This applies only to `next dev`; use it only on a
trusted network and never expose the development port to the public internet.

For a local production preview, build first and then keep the server running:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3002
```

### Development troubleshooting

Keep the development terminal or tool session alive. If the site stops
responding, check the actual listener before starting another server:

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

Stop only the identified stale app process, then restart it. To keep logs
independent of a tool session's output pipe, redirect them to a local file:

```bash
npm run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3000 > /tmp/viselora-hero-next-dev.log 2>&1
```

This command runs in the foreground; redirection does not supervise the process
or keep it alive after its execution environment terminates. `write EPIPE`
means a pipe or socket's receiving end has closed. Inspect its stack and output
destination before assigning a cause; the error alone does not identify which
connection failed. Check the new server response and logs after restarting.

If a hydration error shows an injected attribute such as `trancy-version` on
`<html>`, disable that browser extension for the local site and reload, or
compare with a browser profile without extensions. See the
[Next.js hydration guidance](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error).
Do not suppress all hydration warnings to hide an extension-specific mismatch.

### Validation

Run the full local quality gate with `npm run check`. It includes Next.js/React
Hooks/TypeScript lint rules, formatting, tests, both typechecks and the standalone
package boundary. Use `npm run format` to format app-owned source and current docs.
Individual checks:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm test
npm run typecheck:tests
npm run check:standalone
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

## Boundary

- Consume public Viselora entrypoints only.
- Keep one runtime and one canvas.
- CSS owns semantic DOM layout, accessible theme tokens, stacking, overflow,
  and pointer routing; it does not own the triangular transition window.
- WebGL geometry, face projection, triangular reveal, lighting, shader behavior,
  and motion belong to public package declarations and app-owned effects.
- Do not add raw Three.js ownership, a second renderer, private package imports,
  duplicate visual state, or a Hero-specific package branch.
- Keep runtime/effect declarations referentially stable.

## Current evidence boundary

Current automated coverage, desktop/mobile interaction evidence, and remaining
diagnostics are owned by [the current status](./docs/STATUS.md).
Canvas and DOM glyph
rasterization can still differ slightly, and all content remains a base version
intended for subsequent editorial adjustment.

Standalone verification and migration boundaries are recorded in
[docs/STATUS.md](./docs/STATUS.md). Upstream package ownership remains with
[Viselora](https://github.com/agenticnoob/dom-webgl-workspace).
